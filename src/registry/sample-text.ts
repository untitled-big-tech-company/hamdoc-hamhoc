export const SAMPLE_TEXT = `Curiosity is the engine that drives human progress. From the earliest civilizations to modern breakthroughs in science, the desire to ask "why" and "how" has unlocked unimaginable discoveries. Imagine a world where no one questioned the stars, tested boundaries, or challenged assumptions. We’d still believe the Earth was flat, fire was magical, and illness was punishment. Curiosity fuels creativity, pushing inventors to build, writers to imagine, and scientists to experiment. Yet curiosity isn’t just for grand innovations—it lives in everyday moments. A child poking a stick into mud, a chef tweaking a recipe, or a programmer debugging code all share that spark. To learn faster, think deeper, and solve better, nurture curiosity. Let questions guide you, let failures teach you, and let wonder keep you hungry. By flashing one word at a time in the same spot (e.g., 300–500 words per minute), users avoid the inefficiency of eye movements across a page. This method, called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), allows the brain to focus purely on absorbing information, bypassing subvocalization (silent reading). Over time, users train themselves to process chunks of text faster while retaining comprehension.`;
